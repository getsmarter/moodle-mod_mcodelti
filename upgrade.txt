  configuration content from the preconfigured tool's content selection interface.

* Support for mcodelti 2 added, including extensible services implemented as mcodeltiservice plugins.
* Function sendOAuthBodyPOST removed from OAuthBody.php because it was not being used.
* The field 'grade' in the table {mcodelti} is now an integer rather than a numeric to bring it
  in line with the 'grade' field in other activities.

* mod_mcodelti\event\unknown_service_api_called now has less data stored in 'other'
  but everything is still available for event observers via method get_message_data()
